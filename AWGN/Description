In this folder different communication systems are simulated over the AWGN channel including the following :
1.End-to-End communcation system without a GAN as the channel surrogate.
2.End-to-End communcation system with a GAN as the channel surrogate.
3.Recursive systematic convolutional(RSC) encoder with viterbi decoder
4.Hamming(7,4) code with MLD decoder
5.Uncoded communication system
